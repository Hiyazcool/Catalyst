This Shouldnt be called ReadMe in all Intents and Purposes, BUT I am having fun so f off

------------------------------ Todo : In order of Priority --------------------------------------

	Need to understand why the string is calling destructor
		is it using non ref types?
		is it because I am using a ref then a non ref????????????????
		is it because I am stupid (Probably)
			I believe it has to do with with the Template regard the args as non Ref or OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
				IT ALWAYS HAPPENS AFTER THE SIMPLIFY RETURN VALUE GOES OUT OF SCOPE I THINK 
				Idk
	Learning Events / Setting up Events for Game Engine
	Unique/Smart Pointers
		Going to be Frustrating TBH
	Rebuild Log
		I need to figure out how to use preproccessors properly to really use this effectively
		Doesnt need to be a class, just a namespace
		LONGTERM:
			Output to File for ease of use????????
				Idk
			Can I setup a Non-member Func that I can Overload???????????
				So each different type can overload it (ToLog or something, Idk if ToString is taken in default c++)
				Or is this too complicated? (Probably, Will focus on another avenue like IToString interface or overloading <<) 
	Rebuild Print
		Should be Mostly if Not All inline just use Print as a easier way then cout because cout looks stupid IMO
		Doesnt need to be a class, just a namespace
	Expand on List/Array
		Maybe look into rewrite to optimise
	Thread Manager?
	Deprecated--Expand on String
		Rewrite String (Mostly)
			Implicit Conversion to Char*
			Need to make all operator overloads use char*s or strings idk yet, but I need to prevent ambiguity
				I beleive since there would be a Overload for each it will take the string overload before trying to convert
			Make Most of it Inline?
			Add IPrintable Pointer Overloads
	Build Format
		Needs to be Seperate from string BUT maybe look into Moving some String Functionality to Format Since I THINK I know the Header problem enough to solve
		Doesnt need to be a class, just a namespace
Event Abstract class????? 
	Need to figure out how to implent abstract wrapper for subscribers, I believe I need to go down the pointer route instead of a reference?
	+=/-= control listners (Supplemented by Subscribe/Unsubscribe Functions)
	Invoke/InvokeWithThreads
	
------------------------------ Spicy Ideas -------------------------------------------------------

Stupid Idea, use a function pointer to move a to b in string inside a forloop for each string just to spice things up
use bit shifting to just move the array data directly in chunks????

Also I REALLY WANT TO GET INTO THREADING, but I am hella not ready for it, especially since I want to make a thread manager for it, because I hate myself and love the idea.

------------------------------ Notes For Me ------------------------------------------------------

Make strings implicitly convert to Rvalue References to reduce Overloads and Hopefully fix the Errors

	IMPLICIT CONVERSION OPERATORS
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	WHY DIDNT I THINK THAT IN REALITY IT WAS JUST A CONVERSION 
		IMMMMMM SOOOOO STUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	I am very happy now ^_^
